RESTlets provide one option for integration with NetSuite. Other options include SOAP-based web services, and Suitelets. \SA ID:19203
potential uses of RESTlets generally include the following:

Retrieving, adding, or manipulating data within NetSuite, from an external source. In this sense, RESTlets can be seen as an alternative to NetSuiteâ€™s SOAP-based web services.

Customizing the behavior of pages and features within NetSuite. In this sense, RESTlets can be seen an alternative to other script types, such as server-side Suitelets. The advantage of using a RESTlet compared with a Suitelet is that the RESTlet can return data, in plain text or JSON, to the client script.
One advantage of RESTlets over other script types is that NetSuite requires authentication for RESTlets. If a RESTlet call originates from a client that does not have an existing session in the NetSuite account where the RESTlet is deployed, NetSuite requires the call to include an authorization header.
